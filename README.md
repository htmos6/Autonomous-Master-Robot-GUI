Introduction
This repository contains three code units for a drawing application. The code is written in C++ and uses the Qt framework for GUI development.

Code Units
The three code units are:

drawwidget.cpp
main.cpp
mainwindow.cpp
drawwidget.cpp
This file contains the implementation of the DrawWidget class, which is the main widget for the drawing application. It includes functions for drawing pixels, lines, and triangles, as well as functions for handling mouse events and resizing the widget.

main.cpp
This file contains the implementation of the main function, which is the entry point for the application. It creates a QApplication object and a MainWindow object, and shows the main window.

mainwindow.cpp
This file contains the implementation of the MainWindow class, which is the main window for the application. It includes a menu bar and a toolbar with options for drawing different shapes and changing the drawing color.

Usage
To use the drawing application, run the executable generated by compiling the code. The main window will appear, with a toolbar and a drawing area. Use the toolbar to select a shape to draw and a color to draw with. Click and drag the mouse to draw the selected shape in the selected color. The drawing area can be resized by dragging the window edges.

Dependencies
The following dependencies are required to build and run the application:

C++ compiler
Qt 5 framework

To run the application, use the following command:
./drawapp

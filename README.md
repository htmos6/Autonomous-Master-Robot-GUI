## Introduction
The DrawWidget class is an important component in a system for controlling mobile robots. It provides a visual representation of the robot's planned trajectory, allowing users to interact with and modify the path as necessary. This can be done through the use of a variety of tools and features provided by the class, such as mouse click and drag to draw and edit the trajectory, color selection to differentiate between different paths, and resizing to adjust the canvas to fit the desired path.  

The class also includes functionality for managing the speed of the robot, which can be adjusted through the GUI. This allows users to optimize the robot's movement based on their specific needs and constraints. Additionally, the DrawWidget class provides motion planning capabilities, which can help users to plan the most efficient and effective path for the robot to follow.  

Overall, the DrawWidget class is a powerful and flexible tool for managing mobile robot trajectories. Its intuitive interface and advanced features make it a valuable resource for anyone working with mobile robots, from hobbyists to professionals in a wide range of industries.  

## Usage
To use the drawing application, run the executable generated by compiling the code. The main window will appear, with a toolbar and a drawing area. Use the toolbar to select a shape to draw and a color to draw with. Click and drag the mouse to draw the selected shape in the selected color. The drawing area can be resized by dragging the window edges.

## Dependencies
The following dependencies are required to build and run the application:

C++ compiler
Qt 5 framework

To run the application, use the following command:
./drawapp
